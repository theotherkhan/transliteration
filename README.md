# Devanagari Transliteration
A Python script that can scan a text file and convert devanaagari unicode to roman script. Enhanced with additional support for consonants primarily used in Urdu.

The `/inputs` and `/outputs` folders store the inputted devanagari files and output romanized files, respectively. Input and output filenames are passed as arguments while executing the script:

    python transliterate.py inputs/INPUT_FILENAME > outputs/OUTPUT_FILENAME
